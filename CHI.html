            <p>This is an innovative, unprecedented and challenging opportunity to dramatically reduce or correct disabilities in a population of 1.5 million persons. Impact India believes that this is an exceptional and replicable project which conforms to all the priorities of the Indian Government and International Agencies:</p>

                <li class="collection-item">To develop systems, methodologies and monitoring arrangements that can be successfully replicated in India and developing countries</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>In partnership with the Maharashtra State (endorsed by a Government Order issued on November 7th, 2007), IIF has commenced a Community Health Initiative (CHI), a model National Rural Health Mission in support of the goal to establish a fully functional, community owned, health-delivery system in the tribal areas of rural Thane District in Northern Maharashtra - Palghar, Dahanu, Talasari, Jawhar, Mokhada, Vikramgad and Wada Blocks.</p>
            <p>The CHI aims at the dramatic reduction in a number of disabilities affecting a population of approximately 1.5 million tribals through curative and preventive measures. Impact believes in creating replicable programmes, working with NGOs and mobilising the community.</p>

            <p>A Health Game, based on the conventional Snakes and Ladders game, has been designed specifically by Impact (in English and Marathi) for the use of rural school children. The game seeks to �reward� and reinforce positive behaviour relating to health (climb a ladder) and �punish� and discourage poor health practices (slide down a snake). The Game is simple and effective in communicating various health messages in a playful way.</p>

(1.8%).</p>
                            <p>The distribution of disabled according to the type of their disability shows that a majority of them have Orthopaedic (37%), closely followed by Hearing (32.8%) and Vision (28.4%) disabilities. A few (0.6%) of them have Cleft lips. 2.9 percent of them have more than one disability.</p>

                        <p>Introduced in 2005 the School Health Programme involved the Training of School Teachers by professional organisations (The National Association for the Blind and the Ali Yavar Jung National Institute for Hearing Handicapped) in the identification of vision and hearing disabilities amongst students.</p>
                        <p>In the School Health Monitor Programme, students are asked to vote for their eminently suitable and able peers who would be responsible for early identification of any disabilities amongst their classmates. Health Monitors (HM) in each class - one Monitor for every 10 children - are thus elected.</p>
                        <p>The Health Monitor programme helps to create awareness in children for early signs of illness. The students became change agents for the entire community.The State Government has since institutionalised the School Health programme.</p>

                        <p>Information, Education and Communication programmes. Health messages on the social factors responsible for Malnutrition are communicated through traditional (Warli) folk art - posters, wall paintings, painted earthernware pots, saris, as well as folk dances, music, street theatre and films on CDs. Topics include delay in early marriage, spacing between childbirths, exclusive breast feeding for six months, hygiene and sanitation and immunization against childhood diseases. Awareness on Government entitlements/schemes form a key part of the programme.</p>

                        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> This baby blanket is made up of 16 square 7� x 7� pieces. One blanket to save one of several thousand infants in Impact India Foundation�s Community Health initiative in tribal Thane District, Maharashtra.</p>
                        <p><strong>Proposal:</strong> To create an important focus in order to prevent the large number of infant deaths in the area.</p>
                        <p><strong>Background:</strong> There is a traditional birth practice in tribal areas which needs to be addressed. It is the resistance to cut the umbilical cord as soon as the baby is born. The custom is to leave the cord as it is until the placenta comes out of the mother�s body and it separates naturally � this could take upto one hour. Until that happens, the baby is made to lie on the cold floor near the mother, without clothes and exposed to the vast difference of the heat inside the womb to the cold air outside. No covering is available for the poor mother to wrap here baby. The high rate of infant deaths is linked to this practice.</p>
                        <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To involve School children by initially helping to prevent infant deaths through preparation of simple blankets to keep them warm. This can be followed by arranging for individual school children to personally deliver the blankets to the identified new-borns in the village, with suitable photographs for the school children to keep. This interaction can result in the school children�s abiding interest in the welfare of the infants, with visits to the infants from time to check on their progress and seeking support from their parents and others for material and funds for the upkeep of the infants. It will also encourage Institutional births.</p>
                        <p><strong>Details:</strong> Material can be collected by the school children from local tailors, households, etc. and stitched into blankets. Creative expressions would be painted on the blanket with the school child�s name.</p>

                        <p><a href="downloads/chi-process-document.pdf">Process Document</a> is now available for replication of Community Health Initiative.</p>
                        <p>Impact India Foundation�s (IIF) mission is sustainable, replicable, health models of national priority, using existing delivery systems and available infrastructure. For this purpose, IIF acts as a catalyst to bring together the skills and resources of the corporate sector, professionals, NGOs and the community, in partnership with the Government.</p>
                        <p>IIF�s Community Health Initiative (CHI) is a model in support of the Government�s National Rural Health Mission to establish a fully functional, community owned, integrated, health-delivery system. It covers a population of about two million tribals in rural Thane District, Maharashtra. Having exceeded its objective of 50% reduction in disability, through prevention and cure, by 72%, IIF seeks partners to replicate the CHI elsewhere in rural India. To facilitate this, a Process Document prepared by Tata Consultancy Services is available to interested parties.</p>

                        <p>Capacity building of Government health service providers at the grass-roots level is vital to the sustainability of Impact India's interventions in the Community Health Initiative in Maharashtra. Impact India trains Anganwadi (creche) Workers on monitoring the growth of infants aged 0 to 6 years, and educates them on mobilising pregnant mothers to consume Iron &amp; Folic Acid Tablets, take Tetanus Toxoid vaccinations and go in for Ante Natal Check-ups.</p>

                        <p>Impact India Foundation (IIF) trains Government�s Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) and Primary Health Centres� staff on verifying pregnancies through urine tests and to note the albumin content. IIF teaches ANMs to note that if a woman is under 18 years old or, if her weight is below 40 kgs or, if her Hb level is below 7 gram %, she is an at-risk mother. Treatment from the Doctor or Gynaecologist is essential. Impact India also trains ANMs on monitoring the growth of the foetus and on identifying infections in Post Natal Cases for immediate medical attention.</p>
